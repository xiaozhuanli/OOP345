 I have learn Speacialinzing an Operation for a Dynamic Type, how to use unary expression, 
casting operator.
 1 - The differences between implementation, composition and aggregation.  
- A composition cannot exist without a child class as in reservation module and a parent class as restaurant module. Also, agregation is part of of reservation module but use the ConfirmationSender as a complementing module.
  2 - The difference between the implementations of move and copy functions in a composition and an aggregation. 
  Move functions does not need allocate memory to just do the copy the address. 
  Copy functions needs memory allocation memory when it making a copy.
